# This file comes from: https://github.com/graphql/vscode-graphql/issues/229#issuecomment-698647965
# Keep this file updated with the signature of the directives we use in Relay
# This is needed so that the graphql tools (primarily linters) that use graphql.config.js
# Can pick up these directives and not give lint errors when we use them
