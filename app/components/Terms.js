        <p><b>2.5 Managing and Working on Contracts.</b></p>

        <p><b>2.5.1 Managing Contracts</b>.</p>

        <p>Clients agree to respond promptly to communications with and requests for information from the Contractor and from FlexHire.</p>

        <p><b>2.5.2 Working on Contracts.</b></p>

        <p>The Contractor is responsible for providing all tools and resources necessary to complete the Contract, unless explicitly stated in advance by the Client. Contractors agree to respond to all Client communications and requests for information within one business day. If the Contractor will be unable to meet this requirement due to an absence, he is expected to notify the Client at least 2 weeks prior. After the completion of a Contract, the Contractor can provide timely, honest and objective feedback on the Client.</p>

        <p><b>2.6 Billing and Payments.</b></p>

        <b><p>2.6.1 Contracts.</p></b>

        <p>Contractors agree that there is no guarantee of payment for Contracts. Clients have complete and sole discretion to determine whether a Contractor has completed a Contract and whether to pay the Contractor. FlexHire does not verify whether a Contract has been completed.</p>

        <p><b>2.6.2 Budgets.</b></p>

        <p>FlexHire makes no claims or guarantees to Contractors about authenticity of Clients&rsquo; budget amounts.</p>

        <p><b>2.6.3 Disintermediation</b>.</p>

        <p>Clients and Contractors shall inform FlexHire as to the details of any and all ongoing Service Contracts that FlexHire has facilitated within one week of FlexHire&rsquo;s inquiries for purposes of invoicing. Any action that encourages or causes a lack of response from the Client or Contractor is a violation of this Agreement. Should a Client be found in violation of this section of this Agreement, it will owe FlexHire fees equal to the greater of a) $1,500; or b) had the applicable fees had been applied, plus 20%.</p>

        <p><b>2.7 Payment accounts.</b></p>

        <p>Each Contractor must properly discharge and credit its Client for all payments FlexHire receives from such Client. Each User understands and agrees that:</p>

        <p>The transmission of funds in the manner described herein is not a separate and discrete service that FlexHire provides in addition to its FlexHire Platform services. Rather, transmission of funds in an auditable manner is an integral part of the FlexHire Platform services that FlexHire is providing.</p>

        <p>The FlexHire payment account is a custodial account administered by FlexHire to facilitate disbursement of the Client&rsquo;s payment to the Contractor.</p>

        <p>FlexHire acts as agent of the Contractor and not as a trustee or fiduciary with respect to payments received through FlexHire. The duties of FlexHire as agent shall be entirely administrative and not discretionary.</p>

        <p>FlexHire holds funds delivered to it in a commingled account at a bank, and may include in the titling of that account &quot;FlexHire for the benefit of others&quot; or similar words. FlexHire will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that FlexHire handles as your agent and places in commingled accounts. In consideration for your use of the FlexHire Platform, you irrevocably transfer and assign to FlexHire any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in commingled accounts. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this Agreement grants FlexHire any ownership right to the principal of the funds you maintain with FlexHire. In addition to or instead of earning interest on commingled accounts, FlexHire may receive a reduction in fees or expense charged for banking services by the banks that hold your funds.</p>

        <p>In the event of any dispute regarding the amounts held by FlexHire, FlexHire shall have the right (in addition to all other rights it may have) to deposit all funds held pursuant to this Agreement into the courts of Delaware.</p>

        <b>
          <p>2.8 Non-payment.</p>
        </b>

        <p>If Client fails to pay amounts due under this Agreement, whether by cancelling Client&rsquo;s credit card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means, any work-in-progress will be stopped. Without limiting other available remedies, Client must reimburse Contractor for amounts due upon demand, plus any applicable processing fees, charges or penalties, plus interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum allowed by law, plus attorneys&rsquo; fees and other costs of collection as allowed by law. In its discretion, Contractor may setoff amounts due against other amounts received from or held for Client, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.</p>

        <b>
          <p>2.9 Hold on funds.</p>
        </b>

        <p>FlexHire reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place a hold on funds for Client&rsquo;s and fees to clear or if FlexHire suspects monies may be subject to charge back or if fraud is suspected. FlexHire will release a hold as soon as deemed appropriate. In cases of fraud, abuse or violation of this Agreement, the FlexHire payment guarantee shall be revoked and all monies in a FlexHire account may be held and/or reclaimed, not just those from the Contract(s) under investigation.</p>

        <b>
          <p>2.10 Enforcement of User Agreement and Policies.</p>
        </b>

        <p>FlexHire has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or cancel your access to the FlexHire Platform if it believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement or violated our rights or those of another party. Without limiting FlexHire&#39;s other remedies, we may suspend or terminate your account, use self-help in connection with our rights to reclaim any available funds, and refuse to provide any further access to the FlexHire Platform to you if: (i) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or other written policies and procedures posted on the Site; (ii) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (iii) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users or for FlexHire. Once suspended or terminated, you MAY NOT continue to use the FlexHire Platform under a different account or reregister under a new account. If you attempt to use the FlexHire Platform under a different account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that account and/or use an available payment methods to pay for any amounts outstanding. In addition, violations of this Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions. When your User account is cancelled, you may no longer have access to any parts of the FlexHire Platform, including data, messages, files and other material you keep on FlexHire. All intellectual property provided by Clients for the purposes of completing Contracts will be returned by Contractors immediately upon termination.</p>

        <h4>3. Service contract terms between client and contractor</h4>

        <p>User agrees that all Service Contracts between any Client and Contractor shall: (i) include the terms and conditions provided in Sections 3.1 through 3.10 below (&quot;Standard Terms&quot;); (ii) name FlexHire as an express third party beneficiary under the Service Contract (but not as a party to that agreement); and (iii) make no representations or warranties or enter into any contracts on behalf of FlexHire. Client and Contractor may agree to additional terms in their Service Contract materially different than the Standard Terms; however, nothing in such Service Contract will in any way limit or modify FlexHire&#39;s rights.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.1 Services.</p></b>

        <p>Contractor shall perform Services in a professional and workmanlike manner.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.2 Fees.</p></b>

        <b>	<p>3.3 Termination of a Service Contract.</p></b>

        <p>The Client may terminate at any time but may not recover any payments made to the Contractor unless mutually agreeable. The Client may terminate a Contract at any time if no payment has been made. If a payment in full has been made on a Service Contract, the Contractor may terminate only with written agreement from the Client or after the payment has been refunded.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.4 Client Owned Items.</p></b>

        <p>Client grants Contractor a limited, non-exclusive, revocable (at any time, at Client&rsquo;s sole discretion) right to use the Client Owned Items as necessary for the performance of the Services. Client reserves all other rights and interest, including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights, in and to the Client Owned Items. Upon completion or termination of the Service Contract, or upon written request by the Client, Contractor shall immediately return all Client Owned Items to the Client and further agrees to purge all copies of Client Owned Items and Work Product contained in or on Contractor&rsquo;s premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under Contractor&#39;s control. Contractor agrees to provide written certification to the Client certifying the return or purging of Client Owned Items within ten (10) days after the receipt of the Client&rsquo;s written request to certify.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.5 Work Product.</p></b>

        <p>Any copyrightable works or works for hire prepared by Contractor in connection with Contract for Client shall be owned by the Contractor until payment has been made by the Client and accepted by the Contractor. If the Client pays an amount less than the amount agreed to in the Service Contract, the Contractor may refund the amount paid within two (2) weeks of the payment date and retain ownership of the Work Product.</p>

        <p>To the extent that under applicable law, Proprietary Rights cannot be assigned, Contractor hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Client an exclusive (excluding also Contractor), perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid, and unconditional license to use and commercialize Work Product in any manner now known or in the future discovered. To the extent such license grant is not fully valid, effective or enforceable under applicable law, Contractor hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Client, such rights as Client reasonably requests in order to acquire, as close as possible, all rights equivalent to full legal ownership. In order to ensure that Client will be able to acquire, perfect and use such Proprietary Rights, Contractor will: (i) transfer possession, ownership, and title to media, models, and other tangible objects containing Work Product to Client; (ii) sign any documents at Client&rsquo;s request to assist Client in the documentation, perfection and enforcement of its rights; and (iii) provide Client with support and reasonable access to information for recording, perfecting, securing, defending, and enforcing such Proprietary Rights. Contractor also irrevocably authorizes Client to act and sign on Contractor&rsquo;s behalf and take any necessary steps in order to perfect Client&rsquo;s rights under this Agreement. In the case that under applicable law, Contractor retains any rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as or referred to as &quot;moral rights&quot; (collectively &quot;Moral Rights&quot;) or other inalienable rights to Work Product or Confidential Information under this Agreement, Contractor irrevocably agrees to waive and renounce, and hereby waives and renounces, in favor of the Client, all such rights, or, to the extent Contractor cannot waive such rights, Contractor agrees not to exercise such rights, until Contractor has provided prior written notice to Client and then only in accordance with any reasonable instructions that Client issues in the interest of protecting its rights. Contractor agrees to assist Client in every proper way to obtain and enforce the Proprietary Rights and other legal protections for the Work Product in any and all countries. Contractor will sign all documents that the Client may reasonably request for use in obtaining and enforcing such protection, including, but not limited to, any assignment deed which the Client may select at its sole discretion. Contractor&rsquo;s obligations under this Section 3.6 will continue even after Contractor deregisters from or ceases use of the FlexHire Platform. Contractor appoints Client as Contractor&rsquo;s attorney-in-fact to execute documents on Contractor&rsquo;s behalf for the purposes set forth in this Section 3.6.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.6 Pre-existing Intellectual Property in Work Product.</p></b>

        <p>Contractor shall ensure that no Work Product created or delivered by Contractor includes any pre-existing software, technology or other intellectual property, whether such pre-existing intellectual property is owned by Contractor or a third party including code written by proprietary software companies except specifically for any open source licensed software other than those written with the GPL open source license (collectively "Pre-existing IP") without obtaining the prior written consent of the Client to the inclusion of such Pre-existing IP in the Work Product. Contractor acknowledges that, without limiting any other remedies, Contractor shall not be entitled to payment for, and shall refund any payments made to Contractor for, any Services performed on a Contract if the Work Product contains any Pre-existing IP that was not approved in accordance with this Section 3.7.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.7 Worker classification.</p></b>

        <p>All contract workers are classified as independent contractors working for Flexhire, unless specifically documented and agreed to otherwise by all parties, based on applicable legal guidelines. Contractor does not have authority to enter into written or oral &mdash; whether implied or express &mdash; contracts on behalf of Client.</p>

        <p>Contractor acknowledges that FlexHire does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Contractor&#39;s work or Services performed in any manner. FlexHire does not set Contractor&#39;s work hours and location of work. FlexHire will not provide Contractor with training or any equipment, labor or materials needed for a particular Contract.</p>

        <p>FlexHire will not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes as it would in the case of an employee. Client and Contractor will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority with respect to Contractor&#39;s performance of Services.</p>

        <p>For Contracts classified as independent contractor relationships, Client may not require an exclusive relationship between Client and Contractor. A Contractor classified as independent contractor is free at all times to provide Services to persons or businesses other than Client.</p>

        <p>Contractor agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Indemnified Parties (as hereinafter defined) from any and all claims arising out of or related to their Service Contract, including but not limited to claims that Contractor was misclassified as an independent contractor, any liabilities arising from a determination by a court, arbitrator, government agency or other body that Contractor was misclassified as an employee (including, but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney&#39;s fees), any claim that FlexHire was a Client or joint Client of Contractor, as well as claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation, as well as any claims for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker&#39;s compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.8 Audit Rights.</p></b>

        <p>Client and Contractor each shall: (i) create and maintain records to document satisfaction of its obligations under this Agreement and any Service Contract, including without limitation its payment obligations and compliance with tax laws, and (ii) provide copies of such records to FlexHire upon request. FlexHire, or FlexHire&#39;s advisors or agents, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to routinely, but no less frequently than annually, audit Contractor&#39;s operations and records to confirm compliance. Nothing in this provision should be construed as providing FlexHire with the right or obligation to supervise or monitor the actual Services performed by Contractor.</p>

        <b>	<p>3.9 Entire Agreement.</p></b>

        <p>The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3 and any additional or different terms expressly agreed by Client and Contractor shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding of Client and Contractor with respect to each Service Contract and shall cancel and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and/or other communications between them.</p>

        <b>	<p>5.1 Formal Invoices and Taxes.</p></b>

        <p>FlexHire shall have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for issuing any formal invoices, or for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to Contractor Fees.

Contractor shall also be solely responsible for: (i) determining whether Contractor or FlexHire is required by applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Contractor Fees, and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of itself or FlexHire, as appropriate; and (ii) determining whether FlexHire is required by applicable law to withhold any amount of the Contractor Fees, notifying FlexHire of any such requirement and indemnifying the Indemnified Parties (either by permitting FlexHire to offset the relevant amount against a future payment of Contractor Fees or by refunding to FlexHire the relevant amount, at FlexHire&rsquo;s sole discretion) for any requirement to pay any withholding amount to the appropriate authorities. FlexHire shall have the right, but not the obligation, to audit and monitor Contractor&rsquo;s compliance with applicable tax laws as required by this Section 5.1. Further, in the event of an audit of FlexHire, Contractor agrees to promptly cooperate with FlexHire and provide copies of Contractor&rsquo;s tax returns, and other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit.</p>
